# Copy the changed files for Pull Reqeust to a folder

When you create a Pull Request, you are actually doing a diff between two branches. It makes sense to get a copy of the diff result for other usage. 

For example, many teams are trying to do incremental deployment based on the changes in a merge. This extension will help you generate such incremental deployment packages.

## Tasks included

This extension includes the following tasks

* **Pull Request Diff Copy** - you can specify a target folder to contain your diff files and there will be diff.txt created inside the folder which includes a list of file full paths for later usage, e.g. as a filter for [File Copy] tasks.

### Prerequisites

* Repository must be Git.
* This task must be trigged by pull request, [setup branch policy to trigger a build during Pull Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/vsts/git/branch-policies?view=vsts#require-the-pull-request-to-build). If the build is not triggered by a Pull Request, the task will just skip and do nothing.

### Feature

* TFS and VSTS with Windows Build Agents & Linux Build Agents (You need to use task with 'Cross Platformâ€™, the original task is left in the list for backward compatibility) 
* Branch and Fork
* Diffed file list and generate diff.txt for later usage

## Quick Start

It's very easy to use this extension, you just need to add it right after the 'get source' step in your build definition
